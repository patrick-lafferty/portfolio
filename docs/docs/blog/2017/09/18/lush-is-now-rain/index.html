                    <p>Lush was an interactive Racket shell I started working on this summer to learn Racket. As it turns out there
is already a shell called Lush, the Lisp Universal Shell. So I decided on renaming the project to Rain: 
the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ra</span>cket <span style="text-decoration: underline">In</span>teractive Shell.</p>

<p>Along with the renaming I decided to make the latest feature public. The first version of code completion just picked one completion for you and filled in the remaining characters in a light grey text next to the characters you were typing. I started working on an ncurses-like interface, and the first feature is a dropdown listbox that shows all the possible completions similar to completion widgets in other IDEs.</p>
